# Data exploration and enrichment for supervised classification

Assignment for Machine Learning, 1ºYear, 2ºSemester, Bachelor in Bioinformatics

## Summary
### Goal of the projct

The aim of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting whether patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) will survive one year after diagnosis or not. 

To accomplish this, the project will begin with data preprocessing, followed by the application of multiple Supervised Learning models.
The project encompasses several stages, which involve data exploration, data preprocessing, division into training and testing sets, the selection and training of Machine Learning models like the Decision Tree Classifier, and evaluating model performance through accuracy assessment.

### Tools and algorithms used
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier, K-NN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall
